# Waterwagon Script for RedM Vorp

## Overview
The Waterwagon script allows players to use wagons to transport water from rivers for farming purposes. This script provides configurable options, animations, and features to create an immersive farming experience in RedM Vorp.

## Features
- Transform a wagon into a water transport vehicle, enabling players to bring water from rivers for farming purposes.
- Configurable wagon types and water-carrying capacities for different wagons.
- Animations for filling the wagon with water and transferring water from the wagon to a bucket.
- Customizable bucket types, allowing players to define both empty and filled bucket variants in the configuration.

## Future Improvements
